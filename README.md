## What to Look Out For?

The website is an Awwward-winning website, hence there would definitely be something to look out for. 
- Look out for the **entry animation** on the homepage.
- Look out for **Mouse Follower Circle** on desktop devices.
- Look out for the **Menu Section** that has a hover effect.
- All of this is made **without using any JavaScript frameworks!!!**
